    "### (23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Polymorphism in Python, especially in the context of inheritance, refers to the ability of different classes to provide different implementations of the same method, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. In Python, polymorphism allows you to call methods on objects of different types (derived from a common base class), and each type can have its own implementation of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts of Polymorphism in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Overriding: Polymorphism is often implemented through method overriding, where a method in the child class has the same name as a method in the parent class but provides a different behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Dispatch: In Python, the appropriate method is chosen at runtime based on the objectâ€™s type (this is known as dynamic method dispatch).\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism Through Inheritance and Method Overriding: Polymorphism allows us to write more flexible and reusable code. For instance, if you have a function that processes a collection of animals (which could be dogs, cats, or other subclasses of Animal), the same function can work with all types of animals, but each animal will \"speak\" in its own way."

    "### (24) What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> In Python object-oriented programming (OOP), method chaining is a technique for calling multiple methods on an object in a single line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method in the chain returns the object itself or a derived version of it, which allows the next method to be called on the same object. This means that intermediate results don't need to be stored in variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Method chaining makes code more readable and cleaner by combining multiple actions into one line. It also allows for more complex tasks to be accomplished with a single line of code"

    "### (25) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The purpose of the __call__ method in Python is to create callable objects, which are instances of a class that can be called like a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "The __call__ method allows you to write a class and invoke it as if it were a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a __call__ method in a class to make its instances callable. For example, you can define a __call__ method that defines the function body that's executed when an instance is used as a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Python classes don't implement the __call__ method, but you can add it to custom classes if you need to use your instances as functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the () operator to indirectly call the __call__ method. For example, test() is shorthand for test.__call__()\n",
    "\n",
    "-:  The __call__ method is a built-in method in Python, also known as a dunder or magic method because of the two prefixes and suffix underscores in the method name"
